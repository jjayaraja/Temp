Copilot-Specific Zero Trust Configuration Matrix
Understanding that Microsoft Copilot inherits your existing Microsoft 365 security posture is crucial for proper implementation.

Control Area	Specific Protection	Configuration Location	Key Implementation Notes
Data Access Control	Copilot respects existing SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams permissions - users can only access via Copilot what they already have permission to see	• SharePoint Admin Center
• OneDrive Admin Center
• Teams Admin Center
• Exchange Admin Center	Critical: Audit existing permissions before Copilot deployment. Copilot will inherit all current access rights, including overprivileged accounts
Sensitive Data Protection	Prevents Copilot from processing or exposing classified, confidential, or regulated data	• Microsoft Purview → Data Loss Prevention
• Microsoft Purview → Sensitivity Labels
• Microsoft Purview → Information Protection	Configure DLP policies specifically for "Microsoft 365 Copilot" as a service. Apply sensitivity labels to restrict Copilot access to highly classified content
Identity & Access Management	Ensures only authorized users can access Copilot features with appropriate authentication	• Microsoft Entra Admin Center → Conditional Access
• Microsoft 365 Admin Center → User Management	Create Copilot-specific conditional access policies requiring MFA, compliant devices, and trusted networks
Usage Monitoring	Tracks Copilot interactions, prompts, and generated content for security and compliance	• Microsoft Purview → Audit Log Search
• Microsoft 365 Admin Center → Reports → Usage
• Microsoft Sentinel (if deployed)	Enable "Microsoft 365 Copilot" activities in audit logging. Set up automated alerts for unusual usage patterns
Prompt Security	Mitigates risks from malicious prompts designed to extract sensitive information or bypass controls	• User Education Programs
• Microsoft Purview → Adaptive Protection
• Internal Security Awareness	Focus on training users to recognize and report suspicious prompt behaviors. No direct technical control available
External Data Prevention	Prevents organizational data from being inadvertently shared externally through Copilot	• Microsoft Purview → DLP Policies
• Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
• Network Security Controls	Configure DLP policies to detect and block sensitive data in Copilot outputs. Monitor for data exfiltration patterns
